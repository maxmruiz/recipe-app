# Recipe App

## Description
This application allows a user to build their evening meal with a food and drink selection. 

For the food, the user inputs a food in the search box. Upon clicking 
"Search", an API (i.e., Edaman) is used to retreive an object of food items (with a picture and ingredients) matching the input description.  Then, the list is displayed below with the name of the food, picture, and list of ingredients. 

For the drink (i.e., alcoholic drink), the user inputs a drink in the search box. Upon clicking 
"Search", an API (i.e., CocktailDB) is used to retreive an object of drink items (with a picture and ingredients) matching the input description.  Then, the list is displayed below with the name of the drink, picture, and list of ingredients. 

For both input boxes, a dropdown menu appears where a user can click on a food or drink that they searched for before (i.e., Search history). Under the hood, this feature is using client-side storage to save user inputs to an array. 

Note that this application uses Skeleton for some CSS styling.
